# 🚀 RepoX

_("RePox" is also fine. 😄)_

A tool to do all your CLI dev things without needing to remember the specific commands for each type of project. ✨

---

## 🤔 I'm Sorry, What?

Do you ever get tired of having to type:

- `cargo build` 💻
- `npm build` 📦
- `javac -classpath . app/Main.java` ☕
- `python -m build` 🐍
- `make` 🔧

...in different projects? 😩

What if you had **one tool** that just... 🛠️ **built your thing**, no matter what kind of project it was?

...Anyone? No? 🙃

Look, I get it. This _might_ be a stupid idea. 🤪 For most people. But not for me. I can't explain it. I just want it — and I've wanted it long enough to start building it. 💪

So anyway, I get tired of remembering all the various ways to do basic tasks across repos. This tool detects whether you're in a:

- 🧰 CMake project
- 📦 NPM project
- 🦀 Cargo project
- 🐍 Python project
- 🔩 Make-based project

...and **unifies the commands** so you don’t have to think. 🧠➡️😎

With RepoX, you write a simple `YAML` config once per project type, and expose standardized commands like `run`, `build`, `test`, etc. If your workflow is dead simple, cool — you probably don’t need this. ✅

But if your projects are _not_, maybe this helps. I work on tools that **really could be simpler** — so here we are. 🤷‍♂️

## ❓ FAQ

1. **Aren't you just lazy?**

   > Yes. I am. Lazy as heck. 🦥

2. **Aren't most project commands basically the same? `build`, `run`, etc?**

   > Yes. But not _all_. And as per #1 — I am _lazy as heck_. 🙃

3. **Isn't writing this _more_ work than just learning the tools?**

   > Obviously, yes. Gosh, you're tedious. 😅

4. **But aren't _YOU_ the one asking these FAQs?**
   > ...
   > Shut up. 🤫
